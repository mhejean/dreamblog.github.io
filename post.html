                    <h2 class="section-heading">Dreams About Your State of Health</h2>
                    <p>Our dreams come to us from our inner mind, our subconscious. Every night we experience this state of mind. We also tap into it any time we meditate, deeply concentrate, or listen to our intuition. The subconscious uses images from our waking life to communicate to us in analogies, in symbols.</p>

                    <p>The presence of your car in a dream tells you about your health. The car symbolizes your body. A car in your waking life is a vehicle to move your body from place to place. What vehicle moves your mind from place to place – your body!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Dreams About Your Future Possibilities</h2>

                    <p>Dreams can sometimes be precognitive, giving insight into possible future events. One morning I had a brief dream with some very detailed scenery near some train tracks. That same morning, as I was sitting in my car, waiting for a train – I was startled to recognize that I was in the same exact location as my dream! Some people frequently have precognitive dreams. They might be frightened by predicted accidents and illnesses. The important thing to recognize is that these dreams are not set predictions. They are dreams of the possible future, as in the example of Charles Dickens’s infamous Ebenezer Scrooge. It is up to the dreamer to decide what to do with the information in the dream. The individual always has control.</p>

                    
                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Dreams About The Many Parts of You</h2>

                    <p>If every dream is about the dreamer, than every person is really you! The people in your dreams represent the many different aspects of yourself. When a person pops up in your dream, the first question you want to ask yourself is: “How would I describe this person?” If this person is “kind,” you were utilizing that “kind” part of yourself the day before. However, if you see the person as “lazy” or “stubborn” you may want to take a look at how you were blocked or stagnant that previous day!</p>

                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real</span>

                    <p>Dreams About How You Are Changing...... Death is a new state. If a person dies in your dream, that is a part of you that is changing. Take a look at who has died and look at how they died. Were they killed? Do you know who killed them? Looking at the circumstances of the death, you can decide if this change was wanted or if it felt forced upon you. Knowing who was involved can help you understand what parts of you were involved in this process.</p>
